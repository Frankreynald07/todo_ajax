 AJAX TO-DO SPA (Single page application)

AJAX is a JavaScript technique that allows a browser to send a request to (and receive a response from) a server in the background. Instead of arriving at the browser window, the response arrives in your JavaScript code. You can then use JavaScript to update only the sections of the page that need updating. From the web visitor's perspective, the web page's contents will have changed quickly and the web-app will feel easier to use.
